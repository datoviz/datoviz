# Choropleth map example

This example demonstrates how to create a choropleth map using polygons. It loads polygon data
from a NumPy file, generates a unique color for each polygon, and visualizes them using the
**Mesh** visual. The polygons are displayed with contours.

A **Basic** visual could also have been used, but it would not support contours.

!!! warning

    There may be visual artifacts along the contours of highly irregular polygons, such as those
    in this example. These can be resolved with a more robust triangulation algorithm.
    Improvements are planned for a future release.
