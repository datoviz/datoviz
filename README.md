# Datoviz: GPU interactive scientific data visualization with Vulkan

**Datoviz** is an open-source **high-performance interactive scientific data visualization library** leveraging the graphics processing unit (**GPU**) for speed, visual quality, and scalability. It supports both 2D and 3D rendering, as well as minimal graphical user interfaces (using the [Dear ImGUI library](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)).

**Written in C/C++**, Datoviz has been designed from the ground up for **performance**. It provides native **Python bindings** (based on Cython). Bindings to other languages could be developed thanks to community efforts (Julia, R, MATLAB, Rust, C#, and so on). Datoviz uses the [**Vulkan graphics API**](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) created by the Khronos consortium, successor of OpenGL. Supporting other modern graphics API, such as WebGPU, would constitute interesting developments.

Datoviz is currently being developed mostly by [Cyrille Rossant](https://cyrille.rossant.net) at the [International Brain Laboratory](http://internationalbrainlab.org/), a consortium of neuroscience research labs around the world.

> **Note**: Although its inception and development occurred over a long history spanning more than a decade, Datoviz is still an **early stage library** that would now benefit from increased community feedback. The current [**v0.1x version**](https://datoviz.org/) was released in 2021 and is available in this main branch. The upcoming **v0.2x version** is now available (in a [separate git branch](https://github.com/datoviz/datoviz/tree/v0.2x)) to audacious users for early testing and community feedback.

## Code example

```python
import numpy as np
from datoviz import canvas, run, colormap

panel = canvas(show_fps=True).scene().panel()
visual = panel.visual('marker')

N = 10_000
pos = np.random.randn(N, 3)
ms = np.random.uniform(low=2, high=35, size=N)
color = colormap(np.random.rand(N), cmap='viridis')

visual.data('pos', pos)
visual.data('ms', ms)
visual.data('color', color)

run()
```

## Credits and related projects

Datoviz borrows heavily ideas and code from other projects.


### VisPy

[**VisPy**](https://vispy.org/) is a Python scientific visualization library created in 2013 by Luke Campagnola (developer of [**pyqtgraph**](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)), Almar Klein (developer of [**visvis**](https://github.com/almarklein/visvis)), Nicolas Rougier (developer of [**glumpy**](https://glumpy.github.io/)), and myself (Cyrille Rossant, developer of **galry**). We joined forces to create a single library unifying all of our approaches. There is today a community of users and projects based on VisPy ([napari](https://napari.org/)). David Hoese and some of the original VisPy developers are currently maintaining the library. The current version of VisPy suffers from the limitations of OpenGL, a 30-year-old technology.

In 2020, VisPy received a 1-year [funding from the **Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)**](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/rebuilding-the-community-behind-vispys-fast-interactive-visualizations/) to improve the documentation and knowledge base.

In 2021, VisPy received another [CZI grant](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/vispy-2-0-next-generation-interactive-scientific-visualization-in-python/) for building VisPy 2.0, a completely redesigned library leveraging newer GPU technology such as Vulkan and WebGPU. The current strategy is to rebuild VisPy on top of Datoviz, pygfx (a WebGPU-based library developed by Almar Klein), and other backends.


### Glumpy

Glumpy, developed by Nicolas Rougier, provides [efficient implementations of high-quality 2D visuals on the GPU](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/python-opengl/), using algorithms from the antigrain geometry library. The GPU code of most 2D visuals in Datoviz comes directly from Glumpy.
